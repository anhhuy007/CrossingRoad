<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

"Crossing Road" is a popular electronic entertainment game where players take on the role of a small character needing to cross a busy street. On the road, players must be cautious and control their character to avoid collisions with moving vehicles such as cars and trucks crossing from one side of the road to the other. The main goal of the game is to safely cross the road and collect high scores. The game typically features different levels with increasing difficulty, including faster speeds, wider roads, and the appearance of various obstacles. "Crossing Road" provides an exciting and challenging experience for players who must make quick and calculated decisions to successfully navigate all challenges on the road. With the knowledge acquired and under the guidance of Mr. Truong Toan Thinh, we have been able to recreate the "Crossing Road" game.

### Reason

Programming the "Crossing Road" game helps us gain a better understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. During the development of this game, we will learn how to design and implement object classes to model the game's objects, including characters, moving vehicles, and obstacles. We also need to use the OOP techniques we have learned to manage the game's state and handle events such as collisions and scoring. Additionally, programming the "Crossing Road" game helps us hone programming skills and logical thinking.

<!-- HOW TO PLAY -->
## How to Play

To play the "Crossing Road" game, you need to control a small character to cross a busy street. Here are detailed instructions:

### Gameplay

- When starting the game, you will see a small character standing on the left side of the screen, and a busy street on the remaining side of the screen.
- Press any movement button to start the game.
- Control your character using the arrow keys to move across the road.
- Avoid collisions with obstacles such as cars, trees, rivers, etc., moving from one side of the road to the other. If you collide with any obstacle, the game will end.
- Try to cross the road safely and collect high scores. Each time you successfully cross a lane, you will earn an additional point.
- The game ends when you collide with any obstacle or cannot continue moving across the road.
